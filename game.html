<h1> The game itself </h1>
<p> Clash Royale is multiplayer game on mobile where u most of the time play 1v1. Both of the players has card deck which has 8 different cards. Both of them also has 3 towers at their own side of the arena and goal is to destroy opponents towers and defend your own towers. You get trophies from every battle you win and you lose trophies from every battle that you lose. The goal is to get as many trophies as possible so you can advance to different leagues. </p>
<br>
<p> You will start with 8 cards but you will unlock more of them from chests and just playing the game is the best way to aquire chests. The game has barely over 100 cards at the moment and there are four different card rarities. Higher rarity means that its harder to get the cards from the chests. You need to collect same cards multiple times because then you level up the cards to higher levels and higher level means better stats for the cards.
